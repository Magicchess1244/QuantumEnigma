# QuantumEnigma

This is an amazing game that I made in Unity and that you can try for yourself.
Compiled binaries can be found following this link to [itch.io](https://magicchess1244.itch.io/quantum-enigma)


Dive into this  amazing world to learn how to become the master of time. Inside the laboratory you will learn how to slowdown time, how to transform all of that energy to teleport in to another paralel reality and many more things.


Tips and tricks

if you are stuck in a level to find the solution you will most probably need  to charge something or slowdown time and them you will find the solution.
